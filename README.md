A script project that uses netcat to look for open ports and grab banners
This is also just a project for me to practce scripting and automate a process using Netcat.
It is used to look to see if common ports are open and then grab the banners for the server.
My  idea will hopefully be used  to Pentest a server without having to remember all the commands needed for the basics.
I am super excited to get feedback and new ideas so please let me know what you think.
